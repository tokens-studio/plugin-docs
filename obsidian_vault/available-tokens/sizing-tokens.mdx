# Sizing tokens

You can create tokens that define the width, height (or both values) of a layer. One thing to keep in mind is that in Figma you cannot alter the width of a layer inside an instance, not even plugins can do that.

```
{
  "my-token": {
    type: 'sizing',
    value: '32px',
  },
  "my-other-token": {
    type: 'sizing',
    value: '32',
  },
   "my-rem-token": {
    type: 'sizing',
    value: '2rem',
  }
}
```
