# Applying tokens

There are two ways how you can apply tokens to your selection:

### Default behaviour (left-click)
When you left-click on a token, it is applied to your current selection (multiple layers can be selected). For certain tokens, we provide default assumptions. For example, with `Colors`, we assume that you want to apply the token as a `Fill`.

### Specifying what to apply (right-click)
You can also right-click on tokens to specify a particular token property you would like to set such as `Left`, `Top`, `Right`, `Bottom`, or `Gap` properties in the case of Spacing; can also be set individually.

### Control where to apply changes
You can also control which parts of your designs are updated by utilising the `Apply selector` located at the bottom right of the plugin. You have the following options to choose from:
- Apply to selection (updates only the currently selected elements)
- Apply to page (updates the current/active page)
- Apply to document (updates all pages, which can be slower)

Additionally, we provide you with more control over the updates made after changing a token. In the `Setting icon` next to the apply selector, unchecking `Update on change` for example will require you to manually click the `Apply to` button in order to update the changes on your selection, page or document.
