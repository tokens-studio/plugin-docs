# Transforming design tokens using Style Dictionary

Style Dictionary is a powerful tool for transforming design tokens into usable code for different platforms, such as the web with CSS variables. In this article, we will explore how to use Style Dictionary to transform design tokens.

## Installation

Before we begin, we need to install Style Dictionary. You can install it using npm, which is a package manager for Node.js. Open your terminal and run the following command:

```
npm install style-dictionary
```

## Usage

Once Style Dictionary is installed, we can start transforming our design tokens. Here's an overview of the process:

1. Define your design tokens in a JSON file.
2. Configure Style Dictionary to transform your design tokens into usable code.
3. Generate code for your target platform.

## Configuration

We provide official transforms in the form of a package called [@tokens-studio/sd-transforms](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@tokens-studio/sd-transforms). You can customize these transforms or create your own to fit your needs. More information can be found on npm.
