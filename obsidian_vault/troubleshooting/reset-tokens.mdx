# Reset your tokens
If you run into any problems with your tokens and have problems opening the plugin, you can always reset your tokens.

import { Callout } from 'nextra/components'

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
If you have the tokens only on the local document, you will lose these tokens by resetting the tokens. If you have your tokens connected to an external syncing provider, you can pull the tokens again from the repository after resetting the tokens.
</Callout>

### 1. Open your console

Open your developer tools and go to the console: `Cmd + Option + i` (on a Mac) or `Ctrl +Shift + i` (on Windows) and then click on the `Console` tab.

### 2. Get tokens JSON

Inside the console enter `figma.root.getSharedPluginData("tokens", "values")` to get the token JSON.

### 3. Reset tokens JSON

After you got the JSON via the command above, you can try to fix the JSON (e.g. by copying it into a code editor).

Then enter `figma.root.setSharedPluginData("tokens", "values", "INSERT YOUR JSON HERE}}")` to set the JSON to what you'd like to set it to.

You can also just type `figma.root.setSharedPluginData("tokens", "values", "")` to reset the JSON to an empty state.

### 4. Restart plugin
