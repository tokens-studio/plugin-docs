# Asset Tokens

To make it possible to tokenize logo’s, backgrounds and any other image, we created Asset tokens. The asset tokens allow you to use an image url as a fill for any layer. 
This can be very useful in white-label projects, where you need to change the assets, next to colors and typography.

#### How to use

Create an Asset token under the ‘Asset’ category by clicking on the ‘+’ icon.  
Enter a token name and an asset url.  
import Callout from 'nextra-theme-docs/callout'

> Note: The image source needs to have its own CORS(Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) validation. Some websites already have a CORS validation, but otherwise you can put this behind a CORS proxy. 
More information on CORS can be found [here](https://medium.com/nodejsmadeeasy/a-simple-cors-proxy-for-javascript-applications-9b36a8d39c51).

After creating the asset token, you can apply the token by selecting any layer. The plugin will fetch the image from the url and replace the image on the layer.
