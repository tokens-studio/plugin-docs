# Border tokens

You can create Border tokens to define border styles. The token must contain the following properties:
- Color: the color of the border
- Width: the width or thickness of the border. Can be defined either unitless or with a unit such as px or rem.
- Style: the border style. Currently solid and dashed is supported.

import { Callout } from 'nextra/components'

<Callout>This token will be applied under the `border` property, which was previously used by border color tokens. The plugin will automatically migrate any older applied color tokens under the `border` property to the new `borderColor` one.</Callout>
