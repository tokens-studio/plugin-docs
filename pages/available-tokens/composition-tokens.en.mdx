# Composition Tokens 

If you are on a Pro plan, you can now create and use composition tokens.

Composition tokens are a way to create a token that is a combination of other token types.

For example, you want to create a single token for a card that combines a color token, a border radius token, spacing tokens and a shadow token. This is now possible with composition tokens.

import ReactPlayer from 'react-player'


<ReactPlayer
  muted
  playsinline
  width="100%"
  height="auto"
  loop
  playing
  controls
  url="/composition-tokens.MP4"
/>

### Create a Composition Token

To create a composition token, click on the `+` button next to the `Composition` token section. 

<img src='/composition-1.png' alt="Creating a composition token in Tokens Studio for Figma" width="500" />

In the creation modal, enter a unique name and select the property (fill, borderRadius, width, height etc.) you want to add to the composition token.

<img src='/composition-select-property.png' alt="Selecting property in composition token" width="500" />

You can set a raw value or an alias token for the property.

To add another property click on the `+` icon, select the property and enter the value.

<img src='/composition-add-property.png' alt="Add new property to composition token" width="500" />

Click `Create`, the composition token can now be applied like any other token.
