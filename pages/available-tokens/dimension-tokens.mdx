# Dimension tokens

You can use the Dimension token to define an amount of distance and can be used in a wide range of applications. The dimension token is always bound to a specific unit, either px or rem.

To apply a dimension token, you can right click the token and select the application where you want to use the dimension. This can either be:
- Spacing
- Sizing
- Border radius
- Border width
- Background blur
