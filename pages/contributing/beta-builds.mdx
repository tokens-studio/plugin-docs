# Beta Builds

From time to time, beta builds are released before a new version is published. If you want to get in on this process, let me know on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/six7) by writing a DM.

### Installing a development build

If you received a beta build, here's a short guide explaining how to install it. First of all, it's important that you're using the Figma Desktop app. Development builds won't work on the browser version of Figma. [Download it here.](https://www.figma.com/downloads/)

To get started, click on the menu icon in Figma and type `Manage` â€” you should find the entry `Manage plugins`. Click on it.

Next, click on Create new plugin in the Development section.

Then click on `Choose a manifest.json file` and navigate to where you downloaded the ZIP File. Select the `manifest.json` file.

That's it! You now got a development build of Tokens Studio for Figma. Start it by right clicking anywhere in a document and choose `Plugins > Tokens Studio for Figma (Dev)`
