# Figma Tokens

**Figma Tokens** is a [Figma Plugin](https://jansix.at/resources/figma-tokens) allowing you to integrate Tokens into your Figma designs.

It gives you reusable tokens that can be used for a whole range of design options, from border radii or spacer units to semantic color and typography styles. It allows you to change tokens and see these changes applied to the whole document or its styles.

### Slack Channel

I'm currently setting up a Figma Tokens Slack channel so the community can exchange ideas, best practices or simply ask a question. Want to join? Let me know by sending me a [DM on twitter](https://www.twitter.com/six7) and I'll send you the invite.
