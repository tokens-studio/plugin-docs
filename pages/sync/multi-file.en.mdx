# Multi File Sync

As a pro user you can now sync multiple files at once.

import ReactPlayer from 'react-player'

<ReactPlayer
  muted
  playsinline
  width="100%"
  height="auto"
  loop
  playing
  controls
  alt="multi-file sync"
  url="/multi-file.mp4"
/>

In the `Settings` tab select your remote sync in the `Token Storage` section.

Change the file path by removing the `.json` extension and sync to your folder and sub-folders.
