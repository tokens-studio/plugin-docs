# Sync

As Tokens make most sense in a team environment, some sort of Sync is required to keep values updated while the team is working on different files.

### Sync options
- Local storage (default)
- JSONBin.io
- URL 
- GitHub 
- GitLab
- Azure DevOps
- Generic Versioned Storage

You can choose the sync option in the Settings tab, from where you can add a new sync option.

#### Local storage
By default all tokens are stored in the document where you're working in. If you need to work in multiple documents, this option won't work as it means you'd have to copy paste your tokens to the other document.

#### JSONBin.io
You can use JSONBin.io to create an account and sync your tokens there. It's a free and easy way to sync your tokens, they're not version controlled by default though.

#### URL
Pulls tokens from a remote .json stored on your server. This is a read-only sync method.

#### GitHub
The recommended way as it allows your design decisions to live in the same place as your code lives. Connect to a repository, pull and push tokens or choose a branch you want to push to, which allows you to explore design decisions before pushing them to production. We also support GitHub Enterprise.

#### Gitlab
Like GitHub you can store your tokens on your repository.

#### Azure DevOps
Allows you to store your tokens on ADO.

#### Generic Versioned Storage
An extension off of the URL storage. This storage provider supports read/only, read/write and read/write/create flows. Additionally it can be extended with arbitrary headers on the requests should you need more fined grained support for your endpoint.

#### BitBucket (not yet)
We're planning on integrating BitBucket as well, but have hit a roadblock with their API. If you'd like to support us in that effort, reach out on Slack in #feat-bitbucket-sync.
