# Asset Token
The **Asset Token** captures the location of images, icons, and other visual content within your design system as a Token.

## Design decisions defined by Asset Tokens
When you define your assets as Design Tokens, it becomes easier to maintain consistency across several design elements where the asset appears. 

When the Asset Token is applied to a compatible design element, the asset will fill the layer. 

For example, a product photo across several pages on a marketing website. 

When it comes time to change your assets, you can update the Asset Token in the plugin and apply the changes across your entire design system with just a couple of clicks. 

## Possible Values
An Asset Token can reference any URL or path to an asset file, such as:
- URLs pointing to images or icons hosted online.
- Local file paths if working within a local environment.

The image source needs to have its own CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) validation. 
- Some websites already have that implemented (e.g. Unsplash).
- You can put your images behind a CORS proxy if needed.

‚Üí More information on CORS can be found¬†[here](https://medium.com/nodejsmadeeasy/a-simple-cors-proxy-for-javascript-applications-9b36a8d39c51). 

### Values that reference another Token
When trying to **reference another Token as the Value** for an Asset Token, you will see
- Tokens living in **Token Sets that are currently active**.
	- In the left menu on the plugin's **Tokens page**, a checkmark is visible next to the **Token Set name**. 
- **Token Type** is compatible:
	- The same = `asset`

However, like all token types, you can "force" a reference by manually entering the token name between curly brackets.

import Callout from 'nextra-theme-docs/callout'

<Callout type="info" emoji="‚ú¶">
 The value will show a broken reference until the originating token set is marked as enabled.
</Callout>

## W3C DTCG Token Format
`Asset` is not yet an official Token Type in the W3C DTCG specifications, but there is mention of a 'File' Token Type under consideration ([8.8 Additional Types](https://tr.designtokens.org/format/#additional-types))

## Transforming Tokens
Engineers typically transform Tokens used in code with [Style Dictionary](https://styledictionary.com/), which is tool-agnostic. Tokens coming from Tokens Studio require an additional step: [@Tokens-studio/sd-transforms](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@tokens-studio/sd-transforms), an npm package that prepares Tokens for Style Dictionary. 

When transforming **Asset Tokens**, there are no specific configurations to be aware of. Running the SD-Transforms pre-processor as part of the generic package will prep your Asset Tokens for Style Dictionary.
