# Boolean Token
The Boolean Token allows you to capture layer visibility as a Design Token. It does not control component properties, as Figma doesn't allow it.

## Design decisions defined by Boolean Tokens
Boolean Tokens are great for hiding or showing layers that may be visible within a component under certain conditions. 

For example, a card with some actions that are only visible once the card has been interacted with. 
- You could create two Boolean Tokens:
	- `card.show-actions.default` with a value as `false`.
	- `card.show-actions.interaction` with values as `true`.
- Then, apply the Boolean Tokens to the Actions layer of each variation of the card design. 

**Boolean Tokens** can be attached to Boolean Variables in Figma.

## Possible values
The use of capital letters and spaces is important when writing string values for Design Tokens, so be sure to write your **Boolean Token value** with:
- All lowercase letters.
- No spaces.

### Hardcoded string values
There are only two possible values for the Boolean Token:
- `true`
	- The layer is visible.
- `false`
	- The layer is not visible.

### Values that reference another Token
When trying to **reference another Token as the Value** for a Boolean Token, you will see
- Tokens living in **Token Sets that are currently active**.
	- In the left menu on the plugin's **Tokens page**, a checkmark is visible next to the **Token Set name**. 
- **Token Type** is compatible:
	- The same = `boolean`

However, like all Token types, you can "force" a reference by manually entering the Token name between curly brackets.

import Callout from 'nextra-theme-docs/callout'

<Callout type="info" emoji="‚ú¶">
 The value will show a broken reference until the originating Token set is marked as enabled.
</Callout>

## W3C DTCG Token Format 
`boolean` is not yet an official Token Type in the W3C DTCG specifications. Tokens Studio has added Boolean as a Token Type to support Figma's Boolean Variable. 

## Transforming Tokens
Engineers typically transform Tokens used in code with [Style Dictionary](https://styledictionary.com/), which is tool-agnostic. Tokens coming from Tokens Studio require an additional step: [@Tokens-studio/sd-transforms](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@tokens-studio/sd-transforms), an npm package that prepares Tokens for Style Dictionary. 

When transforming **Boolean Tokens**, there are no specific configurations to be aware of. Running the SD-Transforms pre-processor as part of the generic package will prep your Boolean Tokens for Style Dictionary.
