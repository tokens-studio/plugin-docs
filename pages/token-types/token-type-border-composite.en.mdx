# Border Token
We add visual separation to design elements by composing several stroke-related design decisions together as a **Border**.

**Border** is considered a ***Composite Token***.

Each design decision (color, border width, and stroke style) that is a part of the Composite Token is referred to as a **property** of the **Border Token** in our guides. 

![](/token-types/tokens-border-form-empty-2-01.png)

## Design decisions
The **Border Token** defines the stroke styling properties for containers, text elements, and polygonal shapes. 

The properties within the **Border Token** closely align with the `border` property in [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/border).

Each property of the Border can be created to define an independent styling property and referenced within the **Border Composite Token** as a unique value. 

**Color** 
- The color of the border can be defined by referencing a **Color Token**

**Border Width**
- The thickness of the stroke can be defined by referencing a **Dimension or Number Token**
	- [You may also reference the Border Width Token here, but this Token Type is not officially recognized and will be converted to `dimension` during the transformation process](/token-types/token-type-border-width)

**Stroke Style**
- The plugin doesn't have a dedicated Token for this property, it is defined by entering in the string value `solid` or `dashed`.

It's important to note that **radius** properties are not a part of the Border Token and need to be applied independently. 

**Border Tokens** can be attached to Effect Styles in Figma. Tokens Studio also supports **Styles with Variable References**.

[‚Üí Read the Export to Figma overview for more details](/variables/creating-variables)

## Design properties
A **Border Token** can define each side of the design element independently.
- You choose which side of the element to apply the token by **right-clicking on the token** to see your options. 
	- If you click to apply this token to an element without accessing the right-click token menu, the border properties will be applied to **all** sides. 

While the **Border Token** can be applied to independent sides of a design element, Figma does not yet support independent colors on the same element. 

If you apply more than one **Border Token** to the same layer with independent colors defined, the **last Token applied** will change the color value on all sides.

[‚Üí See Figma's docs on Apply and Adjust Stroke Properties ](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360049283914-Apply-and-adjust-stroke-properties#h_01HNBDJBDZNETDYVBJ18VTDXCB)
![](/token-types/tokens-border-rightClick-all-V2-01-1.png)

### 1. All 
**All** applies the same border properties to all sides of the element.

### 2. Top
**Top** applies the border property to the highest side of the element on the X-axis.

### 3. Right
**Right** applies the border property to the right side of the element on the Y-axis.

### 4. Bottom
**Bottom** applies the border property to the lowest side of the element on the X-axis.

### 5. Left
**Left** applies the border property to the right left of the element on the Y-axis.


## Possible values
Like all **Composite Tokens**, you define the value of each **property** individually. When you create the **Border Token** in the plugin, you can Reference each Token you've already created as a **property** in the **Composition Token** Value or enter a hard-coded value. 

The best practice is to define all parts of a Composite Token, even with a `null/none` value, rather than to leave it empty.

The independent **Token Type** of each **property** within the **Border Composite Token** has unique specifications. Select the Token Type below to get more details. 
[- Color Token](/token-types/token-type-color)
[- Number Token for Border Width](/token-types/token-type-number)  
[- Dimension Token for Border Width](/token-types/token-type-dimension)

### Hard coded values
The color property is the same as the **Color Token** input which accepts modified colors, values from various color spaces, and the use of a color picker. 

‚Üí [Read the Color Token guide for more details](/token-types/token-type-color)

The border width property accepts any of these numeric values:
- Positive or negative numbers.
- Decimal numbers.
- With or without units.

The stroke style property accepts either of these string values:
- `solid`
- `dashed`

### Values that reference another Token
If you'd prefer to reference an existing **Border Composite Token** as the value instead of defining each **Property**, select the Token's **Reference mode button** (2x2 circle icon).

When trying to **reference another Token as the Value** for a Border Token, you will see:
- Tokens living in **Token Sets that are currently active**.
	- In the left menu on the plugin's **Tokens page**, a checkmark is visible next to the **Token Set name**. 
- **Token Type** is compatible:
	- `border`

However, like all token types, you can "force" a reference by manually entering the token name between curly brackets.

 The value will show a broken reference until the originating token set is marked as enabled.

## W3C DTCG Token Format 
`border` is an official token type in the in the W3C Design Token Community Group specifications. [9.3 Border](https://second-editors-draft.tr.designtokens.org/format/#border)

Tokens Studio has approached our **Border Token** differently than how it is defined in the current W3C spec:
- We allow the `borderWidth` property to be a `number` or `dimension` **Token Type** where the spec defines only `dimension`. 
	- We allow unitless numbers where the spec defines a `dimension property` which must include a unit. 
- The spec allows for a dedicated `borderStyle` Token Type, which we do not yet support. 

As we move towards more closely aligning with the W3C DTCG specifications, we may adjust the **Border Composite Token** in the future. 

## Transforming Tokens
Engineers typically transform Tokens used in code with [Style Dictionary](https://styledictionary.com/), which is tool-agnostic. Tokens coming from Tokens Studio require an additional step: [@Tokens-studio/sd-transforms](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@tokens-studio/sd-transforms), an npm package that prepares Tokens for Style Dictionary. 

When transforming **Border Tokens**, which are Composite Tokens, there are specific configurations to be aware of.

**Composite Tokens** require the SD-Transforms option to `expand composite Tokens into multiple Tokens`. 

Make sure you look at the generic SD-Transforms package to include this option, which allows you to further customize this transformation further using Style Dictionary.

‚Üí [SD-Transforms Read-Me Doc, Using Expand](https://github.com/Tokens-studio/sd-transforms/?tab=readme-ov-file#using-expand)

import Callout from 'nextra-theme-docs/callout'

<Callout type="info" emoji="‚ú¶">
*"object, object"*\
 When you transform your Border Tokens and they show `"object, object"`, it means your SD-Transforms configuration needs to be adjusted to include `"expand"`.
</Callout>

If the `borderWidth` property is entered as a number without a unit, the **ts/size/pxx** transform will convert the value to a number with pixels as a unit.
