# Box Shadow Token
We add elevation and depth to design elements by composing many shadow-related design decisions together. 

**Box Shadow** is considered a ***Composite Token***.

Each design decision (color, spread, blur, offeset) that is a part of the Composite Token is referred to as a **property** of the **Box Shadow Token** in our guides. 

![](/token-types/tokens-boxShadow-form-empty-2-01.png)

## Design decisions
While the Token Name is specific to **Box Shadow**, this token supports **Inner Shadow** and **Drop Shadow** design decisions.

Similar to how shadows are defined in [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/box-shadow), you can combine multiple shadows in a single **Box Shadow Token**. 

**Box Shadow Tokens** can be applied to text and container layers to define all shadow-related decisions in a single token. 

Each property of the **Shadow** can be created to define an independent styling property and referenced within the **Box Shadow Composite Token**.
- **X**
	- The horizontal offset that shadow has from the element it is applied to can be defined by referencing a **Number or Dimension Token**
- **Y**
	- The vertical offset that shadow has from the element it is applied to can be defined by referencing a **Number or Dimension Token**
- **Blur**
	- The blur radius that is applied to the shadow can be defined by referencing a **Number or Dimension Token**
- **Spread**
	- The amount by which to expand or contract the shadow can be defined by referencing a **Number or Dimension Token**
- **Color** 
	- The color of the shadow can be defined by referencing a **Color Token**

**Box Shadow Tokens** can be attached to Effect Styles in Figma. Tokens Studio also supports **Styles with Variable References**.

→ [Read the Export to Figma overview for more details](/variables/creating-variables) 


Looking for the **Blur Effect** in Figma? That's currently a property within our **Dimension Token**. 

→ [Jump to the Dimension Token doc for more details on Blur Effect.](/token-types/token-type-dimension)  

## Possible values
Like all **Composite Tokens**, you define the value of each **property** individually. When you create the **Box Shadow Token** in the plugin, you can Reference each Token you've already created as a **property** in the **Composition Token** Value or enter a hard-coded value. 

The best practice is to define all parts of a Composite Token, even with a `null/none` value, rather than to leave it empty.

The independent **Token Type** of each **property** within the **Box Shadow Composite Token** has unique specifications. Select the Token Type below to get more details. 
- [Number token](/token-types/token-type-number)  
- [Dimension token](/token-types/token-type-dimension)  
- [Color token](/token-types/token-type-color)  

### Hard coded values
In the plugin, use the UI button to select between `drop shadow` or `inner shadow`.

The **Box Shadow** properties with numeric values will accept:
- positive and negative numbers
- decimal numbers
- with or without units

The color property is the same as the **Color Token** input which accepts modified colors, values from various color spaces, and the use of a color picker. 

→ [Read the Color Token guide for more details](/token-types/token-type-color)  

### Values that reference another Token
If you'd prefer to reference an existing **Box Shadow Composite Token** as the value instead of defining each **Property**, select the Token's **Reference mode button** (2x2 circle icon).

When trying to **reference another Token as the Value** for a Box Shadow Token, you will see:
- Tokens living in **Token Sets that are currently active**.
	- In the left menu on the plugin's **Tokens page**, a checkmark is visible next to the **Token Set name**. 
- **Token Type** is compatible:
	- `boxShadow`

However, like all token types, you can "force" a reference by manually entering the token name between curly brackets.

import Callout from 'nextra-theme-docs/callout'

<Callout type="info" emoji="✦">
 The value will show a broken reference until the originating token set is marked as enabled.
</Callout>

→ [Jump to the Token Values with References guide for more details](/variables/references)

### Multiple layers
You can add another shadow layer to the current token by **selecting the plus icon button** in the Box Shadow Token form. 

![](/token-types/tokens-boxShadow-form-multiple-V2-01.png)

When you apply the token to your design element in the Figma UI, you will see multiple shadow effects applied, one for each shadow layer you created within your token. 

When you export a multiple-layer shadow to Figma as a Style, you will see a single Effect Style applied, with multiple shadow effects within its value. 

## Effect Styles with Variable references
**Box Shadow Tokens** can be **Exported to Figma** as **Effect Styles** that reference **Color and Dimension Properties as Variables**. 

Before you export your **Box Shadow Tokens** to Figma as styles, ensure:
- Each property within the Box Shadow Tokens has a value referencing another Token. 

When you **Export to Figma**, select these **Options** from the menu:
- `Effect Styles` is selected. 
- `Number` and `Color Variables` are selected. 
- `Create styles with variable references` is selected.

![](/token-types/tokens-boxShadow-stylesvar-ref-2-01-1.png)

Ensure your Export to Figma as Themes or Sets configuration includes all necessary Tokens. 
- Themes and token sets where the referenced Tokens are located are `active`.
- Themes and token sets where the variables are attached may need to be configured as `reference only`. 

You'll notice the Effect Style will be created on Export, with all possible values mapped to the appropriate Variables, based on the Token Type for each property:
- `color` (will create as color variable)
- `dimension` (number variable)
- `number` (number variable)

## Color Styles with Variable references
**Box Shadow Tokens** can be **Exported to Figma** as  **Effect Styles** that reference **Color and Number Variables**. 

Before you export your **Box Shadow Tokens** to Figma as styles, ensure your:
- **Box Shadow Tokens** you want to export as Styles, have values which reference another Color or Number Token.  
- **Color and Number variables have been created** and are attached to the **Tokens Referenced in the value**.

When you **Export to Figma** as **Color Styles**, ensure:
- The option for `Effects styles` is selected.
- The option for `Create styles with variable references` is selected.
- Themes and token sets where the referenced Tokens are located are `active`.

## W3C DTCG Token Format 
`shadow` is an official token type in the in the W3C Design Token Community Group specifications ([9.5 Shadow](https://second-editors-draft.tr.designtokens.org/format/#shadow)).

The plugin had **Box Shadow** support long before the spec defined the `shadow` token, and as a result, we have some legacy decisions which do not completely align with the DTCG spec. 
- We write the `type` as `BoxShadow` where the spec writes it as `shadow`.
	- When you run the SD-Transforms npm package we will adjust this automatically to match the specification, details below. 
- The plugin currently supports **Number Tokens** in numeric value properties.
	- The spec requires dimension values only.

## Transforming Tokens
Engineers typically transform Tokens used in code with [Style Dictionary](https://styledictionary.com/), which is tool-agnostic. Tokens coming from Tokens Studio require an additional step: [@Tokens-studio/sd-transforms](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@tokens-studio/sd-transforms), an npm package that prepares Tokens for Style Dictionary. 

When transforming **Box Shadow Tokens**, which are a **Composite Token** there are specific configurations to be aware of. 

**Composite Tokens** require the SD-Transforms option to `expand composite Tokens into multiple Tokens`. 

Make sure you look at the generic SD-Transforms package to include this option, which allows you to further customize this transformation further using Style Dictionary. 

→ [SD-Transforms Read-Me Doc, Using Expand](https://github.com/Tokens-studio/sd-transforms/?tab=readme-ov-file#using-expand)

<Callout type="info" emoji="✦">
 When you transform your Box Shadow Tokens and they show `"object, object"`, it means your SD-Transforms configuration needs to be adjusted to include `"expand"`.
</Callout>

The preprocessor in the SD-Transforms package will automatically convert the Tokens Studio specific Token Type of `boxShadow` to align with the DTCG Format Token Type of `shadow`. 

→ [SD-Transforms Read-Me Doc, Using the preprocessor](https://github.com/Tokens-studio/sd-transforms/?tab=readme-ov-file#using-the-preprocessor)


The `innerShadow` properties need to be transformed to `inset` to be CSS compatible.
