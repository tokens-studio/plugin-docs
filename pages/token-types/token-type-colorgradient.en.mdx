# Gradient Color Tokens
You can define **Color Token** values as gradients by writing a [css-like syntax](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_images/Using_CSS_gradients). This includes:
- Angle of the gradient in degrees (deg for short).
- Two or more colors.
- The position of each color in percentage.
	- `0%` is the start
	- `100%` is the end

*Limited gradient support*\
Today, the plugin only supports linear gradients when exporting to Figma. 
</Callout>

Here's an example of how to write the value of a linear gradient with two stops that appear to change colors diagonally (on a 45 degree angle):
```
linear-gradient(45deg, #87CEEB 0%, #008000 100%)
```

To add additional color stops, add them between the round brackets, being sure to define the color value and the position as a percentage. 

Here is the same example with a third color stop added exactly at 50%:
```
linear-gradient(45deg, #0000FF 0%, #87CEEB 50%, #008000 100%)
```

You can also **Import Color Styles** of gradients you've created in Figma to see how they are written in the plugin. 

‚Üí [Read the Importing Styles Guide](/styles/styles)  

## Gradients can reference another Color Token
Like **Color Tokens** with a single value, you can reference another Token in your gradients by adding curly brackets { } around the Token name you want to reference. 

Here's an example of a linear gradient with two stops, with colors that appear to change horizontally from light to dark gray:
```
linear-gradient(180deg, {colors.gray.50} 0%, {colors.gray.900} 100%)
```

## Reduced opacity (alpha values)
Like **Color Tokens** with a single value, you can write the value of your gradients to have colors with reduced opacity by defining each color stop in RGBA. 

RGBA colors use a unitless number to define the alpha value, converted into a percentage in Figma. For example:
- `1` = 100% opacity
- `0.4` = 40% opacity
- `0.06` = 6% opacity

Here's an example of a linear gradient with two stops, with colors that appear to change vertically from light with 40% opacity `0.40` to dark gray with 100% opacity `1`:
```
linear-gradient(270deg, rgba({colors.gray.50}, 0.4) 0%, rgba({colors.gray.900}, 1) 100%)
```

This also works when your colors are defined as hard-coded values instead of referencing another Token. 

## Color Styles with Variable references
Like **Color Tokens** with a single value, your gradients can be **Exported to Figma** as  **Color Styles** that reference **Color Variables**. 

Before you export your gradient **Color Tokens** to Figma as styles, ensure your:
- Gradients have values that reference **Color Tokens**.
- **Color variables have been created** and are attached to the **Referenced Color Tokens**.

When you **Export to Figma** as **Color Styles**, ensure:
- The option for `Color styles` is selected.
- The option for `Create styles with variable references` is selected.
- Themes and Token sets where the gradients are located are `active`.
- Themes and Token sets where the variables are attached are `reference only`. 

![](/token-types/tokens-colorGradient-stylesvar-ref-2-01.png)

Note that if the Tokens referenced include modified colors that haven't been resolved, the connection to the Variable will not work as expected. 
- For example, a Token included in the gradient written as `rgba({colors.gray.900, 0.5)` will not be connected to the `colors.gray.900` variable because the plugin has not yet resolved the value, written as a 50% opacity in RGBA.
- You could create a new Token, for example, `gradient-stop` with a value of `rgba({colors.gray.900, 0.5)`, then reference the `{gradient-stop}` Token in the gradient value instead.

## Limitations of gradient color Tokens 
The plugin will support creating Tokens of any [CSS Gradients](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_images/Using_CSS_gradients). However, we are not yet able to create all types of gradients in Figma: 
- Linear - Supported
- Radial - Requested
- Conic - Requested

#### Positioning a gradient on a layer
In code, gradients are["a special type of image"](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_images/Using_CSS_gradients), but Figma doesn't treat them that way. 

As design Tokens are intended to be used in code, we are not able to control the position of a gradient on a layer within the plugin in the same way you can in Figma. 
- The plugin is only able to store the degree of the gradient.
- Without any translation information, the positioning of the gradient on a layer cannot be accurately determined.
- By default, the plugin applies the gradient to the "edges" of the design element you select when applying the Token. 

## W3C DTCG Token Format 
`gradient` is an official Token type in the in the W3C Design Token Community Group specifications.([9.6 Gradient](https://tr.designTokens.org/format/#gradient)) 

However, Tokens Studio has yet to support Gradients as an independent Token Type. It is on our radar as we work towards more closely aligning with the DTCG spec. 

## Transforming Tokens
Engineers typically transform Tokens used in code with [Style Dictionary](https://styledictionary.com/), which is tool-agnostic. Tokens coming from Tokens Studio require an additional step: [@Tokens-studio/sd-transforms](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@tokens-studio/sd-transforms), an npm package that prepares Tokens for Style Dictionary. 

When transforming **Color Tokens** with gradient values, there are specific configurations to be aware of. 

The SD-Transforms generic package will convert color Token values with Figma's "hex code RGBA" into actual¬†`rgba()`¬†format for CSS. 

‚Üí [SD-Transforms Read-Me Doc, ts/color/css/hexrgba](https://github.com/Tokens-studio/sd-transforms/?tab=readme-ov-file#tscolorcsshexrgba)

**Color Tokens** with gradient values are technically a composite Token as it contains multiple values. Composite Tokens require the SD-Transforms option to `expand composite Tokens into multiple Tokens`. 
- Make sure you look at the generic SD-Transforms package to include this option, which allows you to further customize this transformation further using Style Dictionary.

> [!INFO] "object, object"
> When you transform your Color Tokens, and they show `"object, object"` it means your SD-Transforms configuration needs to be adjusted to include `"expand"`.
