# Font Family Token
**Font Family** is not intended to be applied to text elements directly but as a part of a [**Typography Composite Token**](/token-types/token-type-typography-composite)

import Callout  from 'nextra/components'

<Callout type="info" emoji="✦">
*Font Family and Font Weight Tokens work as a pair*\
Figma's unique approach to Font Weight combines several text properties and requires an exact match to the Font Family it is paired with. \
This means you'll need to apply both Font Family and Font Weight Tokens at the same time to interact with Figma's text properties and see a visual change. 
</Callout>

## Design decisions defined by Font Family Tokens
**Font Family** defines a group of related fonts that vary in weight, style or width but maintain a consistent visual appearance and share the same design characteristics. 

In [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/font-family) this property is called `font-family`.

**Font Family** design decisions ensure that text elements are easy to read in a particular context while representing the visual style of the brand/product/service. 

A design system will typically define which **Font Family** is to be used when text within a visual design calls for:
- serif font
- sans-serif font 
- mono-spaced font 
- decorative font

Figma combines the **Font Family** property with its **Font Weight** and some styling properties, which differs from how they are defined in code. 
- It's helpful to think of the **Font Family** and **Font Weight Tokens** as a pair and create/apply them together whenever possible. 

**Font Family Tokens** can be attached to String Variables in Figma. 

→ [Jump to the Export to Figma overview for more details on Font Family Tokens as Variables](/variables/creating-variables)

## Possible values
The value of a **Font Family Token** must be identical to the text string value for the Font Family in the Figma design panel due to limitations from Figma (plugin API). 

When writing the value of a **Font Family Token**, pay close attention to:
- Spelling
- Spacing
- Punctuation
- Use of capital letters

### Hard-coded values
To ensure your **Font Family Token** values are an exact match to what Figma has, you can:
- Carefully type it out, paying attention to the syntax in Figma.
- Save your **Font Family** and **Font Weight** pairs as text styles in Figma, then import them into the plugin to see how they appear. 
- Select the value from the Tokens Studio menu, pictured below.

### Values that reference another Token
When trying to **reference another Token as the Value** for a Font Family Token, you will see
- Tokens living in **Token Sets that are currently active**.
	- In the left menu on the plugin's **Tokens page**, a checkmark is visible next to the **Token Set name**. 
- **Token Type** is compatible:
	- The same = `fontFamilies`

However, like all token types, you can "force" a reference by manually entering the token name between curly brackets.

The value will show a broken reference until the originating token set is marked as enabled.

## W3C DTCG Token Format 
**Font Family** is an official token type in the in the W3C Design Token Community Group specifications.( [8.3 Font Family](https://tr.designtokens.org/format/#font-family))

It is mentioned as a required part of a [typography token](https://tr.designtokens.org/format/#typography)
> "The typography's font. The value of this property *MUST* be a valid font family value or a reference to a font family token." - 9.7. Typography

## Token Type syntax
The **Font Family Token** has a unique syntax in code which identifies if the token is:
- An independent property Token 
- Part of a Typography Composite Token

Looking at the JSON format, the  `"type"` is written in plural  `"fontFamilies`" when the Font Size Token is defined as an independent property Token. 

This example shows a Font Family property Token named `font-family-sans` with a value of `Satoshi Variable`:
```
{
  "font-family-sans": {
      "value": "Satoshi Variable",
      "type": "fontFamilies"
    }
  }
``````

This is in contrast to the Typography Composite Token, which has the property Token `"type"` written in the singular `"fontFamily"`.

This example shows a Typography composite token with the **Font Family Token** named `font-family-sans` referenced as the value.
```
{
  "paragraph-3": {
    "value": {
      "fontFamily": "{font-family-sans}",
      "fontWeight": "{font-weight-default}",
      "lineHeight": "{line-height-classic}",
      "fontSize": "{font-size-small}",
      "letterSpacing": "{letter-spacing-tight}",
      "paragraphSpacing": "{paragraphSpacing.none}"
      "paragraphIndent": "{paragraphIndent.none}"
      "textCase": "{textCase.none}",
      "textDecoration": "{textDecoration.none}"
    },
    "type": "typography"
  }
}
``````

## Transforming Tokens
Engineers typically transform Tokens used in code with [Style Dictionary](https://styledictionary.com/), which is tool-agnostic. Tokens coming from Tokens Studio require an additional step: [@Tokens-studio/sd-transforms](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@tokens-studio/sd-transforms), an npm package that prepares Tokens for Style Dictionary. 

When transforming Font Family Tokens, there are specific configurations to be aware of. 

The preprocessor in the SD-Transforms package will automatically convert the Tokens Studio specific Token Type of `fontFamilies` to align with the DTCG Format Token Type of `fontFamily`. 

→ [SD-Transforms Read-Me Doc, Using the preprocessor](https://github.com/Tokens-studio/sd-transforms/?tab=readme-ov-file#using-the-preprocessor)


A **Font Family Token** entered as a text string value matching the Figma API that needs to be converted into valid CSS, adding single quotes if necessary.

→ [SD-Transforms Read-Me Doc, CSS - Font Family ](https://github.com/tokens-studio/sd-transforms/?tab=readme-ov-file#tstypographycssfontfamily) #transform-doc-link/broken


Font Family, as a part of Typography Composite Tokens, require the SD-Transforms option to `expand composite Tokens into multiple Tokens`. 

Make sure you look at the generic SD-Transforms package to include this option, which allows you to further customize this transformation further using Style Dictionary. 

→ [SD-Transforms Read-Me Doc, Generic - expand composite Tokens](https://github.com/Tokens-studio/sd-transforms/?tab=readme-ov-file#tstypographycssshorthand:~:text=does%20so%20for-,typography%2C,-border%20and%20shadow)

<Callout type="info" emoji="✦">
*"object, object"*\
When you transform your Typography Tokens, and they show `"object, object"` it means your SD-Transforms configuration needs to be adjusted to include `"expand"`.
