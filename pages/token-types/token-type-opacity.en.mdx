# Opacity Token
The **Opacity Token** allows you to capture the transparency of a layer as a Design Token. 

![](/token-types/tokens-opacity-form-empty-2-01.png)

## Design decisions defined by Opacity Tokens
Opacity Tokens define a layer's opacity. In Figma, they can be applied to any design element that supports reduced opacity. 

For example, you might have a Button that changes opacity when hovered over. 
- You could create two Opacity tokens:
	- `button.opacity.default` with a value of `1` (fully opaque)
	- `button.opacity.hover` with a value of `0.8` (slightly transparent)
- Then, apply the Opacity Tokens to the background container layer of each variation of the Button design. 

## Possible Values
An Opacity Token can define any level of transparency from fully opaque to fully transparent. The values range from:
- `1` (layer is fully opaque)
- `0` (layer is fully transparent)
- Any decimal value between `0` and `1` can be used to set varying levels of transparency.

### Values that reference another Token
When trying to **reference another Token as the Value** for an Opacity Token, you will see
- Tokens living in **Token Sets that are currently active**.
	- In the left menu on the plugin's **Tokens page**, a checkmark is visible next to the **Token Set name**. 
- **Token Type** is compatible:
	- The same = `opacity`

However, like all token types, you can "force" a reference by manually entering the token name between curly brackets.

import Callout from 'nextra-theme-docs/callout'

<Callout type="info" emoji="‚ú¶">
The value will show a broken reference until the originating token set is marked as enabled.
</Callout>

## W3C DTCG Token Format 
Opacity is not yet an official token type in the W3C DTCG specifications, but there is mention of a `Percentage/radio` type under consideration ([8.8 Additional Types](https://tr.designtokens.org/format/#additional-types))

## Transforming Tokens
Engineers typically transform Tokens used in code with [Style Dictionary](https://styledictionary.com/), which is tool-agnostic. Tokens coming from Tokens Studio require an additional step: [@Tokens-studio/sd-transforms](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@tokens-studio/sd-transforms), an npm package that prepares Tokens for Style Dictionary. 

When transforming **Opacity Tokens**, there are specific configurations to be aware of.

For **Opacity Token** values entered in percentages, the SD-transforms package converts the value from¬†`%`¬†to number between¬†`0`¬†and¬†`1`¬†->¬†`ts/opacity`.

### Known issues and bugs
Tokens Studio Plugin GitHub - [Open issues for Token Type Opacity](https://github.com/tokens-studio/figma-plugin/labels/token%20type%20opacity)
- Opacity issue: some values are wrongly rounded in Figma [#2380](https://github.com/tokens-studio/figma-plugin/issues/2380)
	- Values entered less than 1% are resolving to 1% in Figma 
	- Ex: `0.1%` will resolve to 1% 
- Referencing a (base+opacity) and adding another opacity to that, doesn't give the correct result [#1822](https://github.com/tokens-studio/figma-plugin/issues/1822)
	- Including an Opacity Token in the value of a Color Token produces unexpected results. 
	- We may want to avoid using Opacity Tokens in Color Token values as Figma assigns the Opacity value to layer transparency and not a color modifier. 
- Using Opacity in Tokens Creates Blank Variable [#2977](https://github.com/tokens-studio/figma-plugin/issues/2977)
	- When Exporting Color Tokens with Opacity Tokens referenced in the value as Color Variables, the Variable is not created as expected. 
	- Likely related to issue 1822 above.
