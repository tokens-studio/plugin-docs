# Token Types in the Plugin
The Tokens Studio (TS) plugin for Figma supports 24 unique **Token Types**. 

Recall that The `type` of Design Token defines which category of design property this decision belongs to, or ***when*** it can be applied.

## Terms to be aware of
Across our docs, you'll notice we describe Token Types in different terms. 

**Official**
- 'Official' Token Types are listed in the [W3C Design Tokens Community Group (DTCG) Specifications for Design Tokens](https://tr.designtokens.org/format/#types)
- For example, **Dimension Token** is an official type.

**Unofficial**
- 'Unofficial' Token Types were created by Tokens Studio before the W3C DTCG Specs defined an alternate Token Type. 
- For example, **Border Width Token** is an unofficial type defined by the spec as a **Dimension Token**. 
- Tokens Studio will continue to support unofficial Token Types for now. We've already built a conversion into our SD-transforms script; more details are below. 
- Any Token Types we are planning to deprecate will be listed as `legacy`. 

**Composite**
- When elements are styled by composing many related design decisions together, they are combined into a **Composite** Token Type. 
- For example, a **Typography Token** is composed of 9 independent text-related properties.
- **Property**
- Each design decision that is a part of the **Composite Token** is referred to as a **Property** of their respective Composite Token in our guides. 
- For example, **Font Family and Font Weight Tokens** are **Unofficial Tokens** we created to independently define the Properties that Compose a **Typography Token**.

**Compatible**
- A Token Type with properties that is compatible with another Token Type. For example, the `dimension` Token Type is compatible with `fontSize` when referenced within a `typography` Composite Token. 
- Compatible Token Types are visible by default when defining Token Values which reference another Token in the plugin.

*Disclaimer on these terms*\
These descriptive terms are not the only way to describe Token Types; they are the labels the Tokens Studio team uses for simplicity across our documentation. If your team uses different descriptive terms, that's totally okay!

## Transforming Tokens
To use Design Tokens in code, engineers need to transform them from their tool/platform-agnostic format to meet their programming needs. Engineers typically transform Tokens used in code with [Style Dictionary](https://styledictionary.com/), which is tool-agnostic and based on the Token Format in the DTCG specifications. 

![](/token-types/TS-git-SD.png)

Tokens coming from Tokens Studio require an additional step: [@tokens-studio/sd-transforms](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@tokens-studio/sd-transforms), an npm package that prepares tokens for Style Dictionary. 

Some Tokens we create in Tokens Studio have subtle differences in how the Token `type` is written compared to the DTCG specifications. In the case of **unofficial** Token Types, which don't exist in the DTCG spec, we have to transform the **TS Type** into something Style Dictionary is prepared to work with. 

The SD-Transforms package's preprocessor will transform the **TS Token Type** to the **Style Dictionary Type**, as described in the table below.
