# Paragraph Spacing Token
**Paragraph Spacing** is not intended to be applied to text elements directly but as a part of a [**Typography Composite Token**.](/token-types/token-type-typography-composite)

## Design decisions defined by Paragraph Spacing Tokens
**Paragraph Spacing** defines the vertical distance between 2 paragraphs of text.

This isn't a typical CSS property; you could define it by adding a [margin to your paragraphs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/p#accessibility_concerns)

import Callout from 'nextra-theme-docs/callout'

*This property does not appear in Dev Mode*\
While you can apply the Token using the plugin to change Figma's Paragraph Spacing property, this value does not have a CSS equivalent property so it does not show up in Dev Mode when inspecting CSS. \\

The token applied will show up when inspecting Tokens Studio in Dev Mode.\\

When we apply a **Typography Composite Token** to a text layer in Figma, these **Paragraph Spacing** values will change the text layer:
- Preferred value - `0`
	- No additional space between paragraphs. 
	- A line break would be added to create the space needed instead.
		- This most closely matches how spacing between paragraphs would be done in code. 
- Relative to **Font Size**  - `value in rem units` 
	- Example: **Paragraph Spacing**  at `0.5rem` with **Font Size** at `1rem`
		- A person who has increased the font size of a mobile phone will see the space between paragraphs half the size of the text.
- Fixed - `value in pixels`
	- Example `8px`
		- The space between paragraphs will remain the same as a user zooms into a webpage.

**Paragraph Spacing Tokens** can be attached to Number Variables in Figma.

## Possible values
Like all Tokens defining a dimension design decision, the value of a **Paragraph Spacing Token** must include a numeric value and, ideally, a unit of measure. 

Tokens without a unit specified are applied as the pixel equivalent in Figma. 

## Hard-coded values
When writing the hard-coded values for a **Paragraph Spacing Token**, you'll want to:
- Avoid spaces
- Include a number and unit of measure.
	- Values without a unit will be translated to pixels in Figma.
	- The value should always be greater than 0. 
- Or use the specified string (below) for the `normal` value.

#### rem units (rem)
To support responsive design, you can define your **Paragraph Spacing Token** in **rem units**, and the plugin automatically converts the value to the pixel equivalent. 
 - For example, a **Paragraph Spacing Token** with a value of `1rem`, when applied as a **Typography Composite Token, will appear as `16px` in Figma.
 
**Rem Units** act as a multiplier of the **base font size**, so when a user changes their preferences to a larger font size or uses a zoom feature in your product, elements defined in **rem units** will respond accordingly. 

The value of `1rem` can be configured in the plugin **Settings** for **Base Font Size**.

‚Üí [Read the guide on Base Font Size in the plugin](/tokens/settings#base-font-size)

#### pixels (px)
If your design requires a fixed value, you can define your **Paragraph Spacing Token** in **pixel units**, for example:
```
32px
```

### Values that reference another Token
When trying to **reference another Token as the Value** for a Paragraph Spacing Token, you will see
- Tokens living in **Token Sets that are currently active**.
	- In the left menu on the plugin's **Tokens page**, a checkmark is visible next to the **Token Set name**. 
- **Token Type** is compatible:
	- The same = `paragraphSpacing`
	- `dimension`
	- `number`

However, like all token types, you can "force" a reference by manually entering the token name between curly brackets.

<Callout type="info" emoji="‚ú¶">
The value will show a broken reference until the originating token set is marked as enabled.

## W3C DTCG Token Format 
**Paragraph Spacing** is not an official token type in the W3C Design Token Community Group specifications.

Tokens Studio has added **Paragraph Spacing** as a token type to support Figma's unique approach to this text property.

## Transforming Tokens
Engineers typically transform Tokens used in code with [Style Dictionary](https://styledictionary.com/), which is tool-agnostic. Tokens coming from Tokens Studio require an additional step: [@Tokens-studio/sd-transforms](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@tokens-studio/sd-transforms), an npm package that prepares Tokens for Style Dictionary. 

When transforming Paragraph Spacing Tokens, there are specific configurations to be aware of.

The preprocessor in the SD-Transforms package will automatically convert the Tokens Studio specific Token Type of `paragraphSpacing` to align with the DTCG Format Token Type of `dimension`. 

‚Üí [SD-Transforms Read-Me Doc, Using the preprocessor](https://github.com/Tokens-studio/sd-transforms/?tab=readme-ov-file#using-the-preprocessor)


**Paragraph Spacing**, as part of **Typography Composite Tokens**, requires the SD-Transforms option to `expand composite Tokens into multiple Tokens`. 

Make sure you look at the generic SD-Transforms package to include this option, which allows you to further customize this transformation further using Style Dictionary.
