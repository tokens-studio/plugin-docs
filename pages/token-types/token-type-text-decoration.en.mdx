# Text Decoration Token 
**Text Decoration** is not intended to be applied to text elements directly but as a part of a [**Typography Composite Token**](/token-types/token-type-typography-composite)

## Design decisions defined by Text Decoration Tokens
**Text Decoration** defines an optional line as a part of font styling properties, typically used to communicate the visual emphasis of text. 

In [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/text-decoration), this property is called `text-decoration`.

When we apply a **Typography Composite Token** to a text layer in Figma, these **Text Decoration** values will change the text:
- By default - no lines are added to the text - `null`
	- The text appears as typed with no decoration added.
- A line below the text - `underline`
	- It commonly indicates interactive text elements, like links.
- A line in the middle of the text - `strike-through` 
	- It commonly indicates information that is no longer accurate, like a to-do item that has been completed.

## Possible values
The value of a **Text Decoration Token** must be identical to the text string value for Font Family in the Figma design panel due to limitations from Figma (plugin API). 

When writing the value of a **Text Decoration Token**, pay close attention to:
- Spelling
- Spacing
- Punctuation
- Use of capital letters

### Hard-coded values
The **Text Decoration Token** has a few specific values depending on your needs.
#### null
Most of the time, text will appear as typed; the Text Decoration Value will be:
```
null
```

#### underline
To create a line at the bottom of the text, enter the Text Decoration Value as:
```
underline
```

#### strike-through
To create a line through the centre of the text, enter the Text Decoration Value as:
```
strike-through
```

#### Not supported by Figma
There are additional `text-decoration` properties commonly used in CSS that are not supported in Figma. 
- Overline
- Line-above

Using the Tokens Studio plugin, you can still create a **Text Decoration Token** with these values. 

When you apply them to design elements in Figma, the Token will be present and visible to engineers inspecting the design element in Figma, but the Token won't interact with the Text decoration property in Figma's UI. 

### Values that reference another Token
When trying to **reference another Token as the Value** for a Line Height Token, you will see
- Tokens living in **Token Sets that are currently active**.
	- In the left menu on the plugin's **Tokens page**, a checkmark is visible next to the **Token Set name**. 
- **Token Type** is compatible:
	- The same = `textDecoration`

However, like all Token types, you can "force" a reference by manually entering the Token name between curly brackets.

import Callout from 'nextra-theme-docs/callout'

<Callout type="info" emoji="‚ú¶">
The value will show a broken reference until the originating Token set is marked as enabled.
</Callout>

## W3C DTCG Token Format 
**Text Decoration** is not yet an official Token type in the W3C Design Token Community Group specifications.

Tokens Studio has added **Text Decoration** as a Token type in anticipation it will be added to the W3C specs in the near future. 

## Transforming Tokens
Engineers typically transform Tokens used in code with [Style Dictionary](https://styledictionary.com/), which is tool-agnostic. Tokens coming from Tokens Studio require an additional step: [@Tokens-studio/sd-transforms](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@tokens-studio/sd-transforms), an npm package that prepares Tokens for Style Dictionary. 

This property in Figma matches CSS, so there is no specific transform for Text Decoration. 

However, **Text Decoration**, as part of **Typography Composite Tokens**, requires the SD-Transforms option to `expand composite Tokens into multiple Tokens`. 

Make sure you look at the generic SD-Transforms package to include this option, which allows you to further customize this transformation further using Style Dictionary.
