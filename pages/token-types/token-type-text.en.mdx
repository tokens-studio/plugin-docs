# Text Token
The **Text Token** allows you to capture written content as Design Tokens. 

![](/token-types/tokens-text-form-empty-2-01.png)

## Design decisions defined by Text tokens
Text Tokens define the written content in your designs and can be applied to text elements. 

Useful for:
- UX writing
- Creating themes for different languages 
- Capturing translations
- When your product or brand names are still being iterated on 

Text Tokens can be attached to String Variables in Figma. 

→ [Jump to the Export to Figma overview for more details on Text Tokens as Variables](/variables/creating-variables) 

## Possible values
Text Token can have any combination of alpha-numeric values and may include emojis. 

### Hard-coded string values
Hard-coded values of Text Token would be a string of text you define directly. 

For example, a Text Token named `welcome.message` with the hard-coded value of:
```
"Hello world"
```

<Callout type="error" emoji="✦">
*Known Issue*\
Text Tokens with values that are numeric only are not applying as expected. 
</Callout>

### Values that reference another token
The **Value** of a Text Token can reference another Text Token. 

For example a Text Token named `app.home-page.message` with a raw value of:
```
{welcome.message}
```

Which would inherit the text content from the `welcome.message` token and have a resolved value of `"Hello world"`. 

When trying to **reference another Token as the Value** for a Text Token, you will see
- Tokens living in **Token Sets that are currently active**.
	- In the left menu on the plugin's **Tokens page**, a checkmark is visible next to the **Token Set name**. 
- **Token Type** is compatible:
	- The same = `text`

However, like all token types, you can "force" a reference by manually entering the token name between curly brackets.

import { Callout } from 'nextra/components'

<Callout type="info" emoji="✦">
The value will show a broken reference until the originating token set is marked as enabled.
</Callout>

→ [Jump to the Token Values with References guide for more details](/variables/references)

#### Nested references
Text Token can also reference another token nested somewhere within the value. 

For example, a Text Token with a Name of `customer-id` with the hard-coded value of:
```
Jan Six
```

When referenced within the value of another Text Token with a Name of `app.home-page.title`:
```
👋 Welcome back, {customer-id}!
```

Which would inherit the text content from the `customer-id` token and have a resolved value of `👋 Welcome back, Jan Six!`

This is a great way to communicate to engineers the design decision to have text content; in this case, the client name comes from a database. 
- You could even add some notes in the description for engineers, like `"show the preferred name as the client ID if it exists in the database."`

## W3C DTCG Token Format 
**Text** is not yet an official token type in the W3C DTCG specifications. Tokens Studio has added Text as a token type to support Figma's String Variable. 


## Transforming Tokens
Engineers typically transform Tokens used in code with [Style Dictionary](https://styledictionary.com/), which is tool-agnostic. Tokens coming from Tokens Studio require an additional step: [@Tokens-studio/sd-transforms](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@tokens-studio/sd-transforms), an npm package that prepares Tokens for Style Dictionary. 

When transforming **TextTokens**, there are specific transforms to be aware of. 

The preprocessor in the SD-Transforms package will automatically convert the Tokens Studio specific Token Type of `text` to align with the Style Dictionary compatible Token Type of `content`. 

→ [SD-Transforms Read-Me Doc, Using the preprocessor](https://github.com/Tokens-studio/sd-transforms/?tab=readme-ov-file#using-the-preprocessor)


**Text Case**, as part of **Typography Composite Tokens**, requires the SD-Transforms option to `expand composite Tokens into multiple Tokens`. 

Make sure you look at the generic SD-Transforms package to include this option, which allows you to further customize this transformation further using Style Dictionary.
