# Typography Token
We style text elements by composing many typography-related design decisions together. 

**Typography** is considered a ***Composite Token***.

In our guides, each design decision (font size, letter spacing, etc.) that is part of the Composite Token is referred to as a **property** of the Typography Token. 

## Design decisions defined by Typography Tokens
**Typography Tokens** define a group of properties used to style text elements. 

[In CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Styling_text/Fundamentals), this is known as the `Text and Font Styling` properties, which are defined individually. 

**Typography Tokens** can be applied to text layers to define all styling decisions in a single token. 
- Individual Tokens can be created to define each independent styling property and combined to create the **Typography Composite Token**.

![](/token-types/tokens-typography-form-annotated-2-01.png)

Tokens Studio supports these text and font styling design decisions to be combined within the **Typography Composite Token**:
1. [Font family](/token-types/token-type-font-family)
2. [Font weight](/token-types/token-type-font-weight)
3. [Font size](/token-types/token-type-font-size)
4. [Line height](/token-types/token-type-line-height)
5. [Letter spacing](/token-types/token-type-letter-spacing)
6. [Paragraph indent](/token-types/token-type-paragraph-indent)
7. [Paragraph spacing](/token-types/token-type-paragraph-spacing)
8. [Text decoration](/token-types/token-type-text-decoration)
9. [Text case](/token-types/token-type-text-case)

**Typography Tokens** can be attached to Text Styles in Figma. Tokens Studio also supports Styles with Variable References.

## Possible values
Like all **Composite Tokens**, you define the value of each **property** individually. When you create the **Typography Token** in the plugin, you can Reference each Token you've already created as a **property** in the **Composition Token** Value or enter a hard-coded value. 

The best practice is to define all parts of a Composite Token, even with a `null/none` value, rather than to leave it empty.

The independent **Token Type** of each **property** within the **Typography Composite Token** has unique specifications. Select the Token Type below to get more details. 
- [Font family](/token-types/token-type-font-family)
- [Font weight](/token-types/token-type-font-weight)
- [Font size](/token-types/token-type-font-size)
- [Line height](/token-types/token-type-line-height)
- [Letter spacing](/token-types/token-type-letter-spacing)
- [Paragraph indent](/token-types/token-type-paragraph-indent)
- [Paragraph spacing](/token-types/token-type-paragraph-spacing)
- [Text decoration](/token-types/token-type-text-decoration) 
- [Text case](/token-types/token-type-text-case)

### Using Math
Each property defined within the **Typography Token** that requires numeric values supports accepting math equations. 

→ [Read the guide on Tokens with Math Values for more details.](/tokens/using-math)

### Values that reference another Token
If you'd prefer to reference an existing **Typography Composite Token** as the value instead of defining each **Property**, select the Token's **Reference mode button** (2x2 circle icon).

When trying to **reference another Token as the Value** for a Typography Token, you will see
- Tokens living in **Token Sets that are currently active**.
	- In the left menu on the plugin's **Tokens page**, a checkmark is visible next to the **Token Set name**. 
- **Token Type** is compatible:
	- `typography`

![](/token-types/tokens-typography-form-references-both-2-01.png)

However, like all token types, you can "force" a reference by manually entering the token name between curly brackets.

import Callout from 'nextra-theme-docs/callout'

<Callout type="info" emoji="✦">
The value will show a broken reference until the originating token set is marked as enabled.
</Callout>

## Limitations of Typography Tokens
When working with Typography Tokens, there are a few known limitations to keep in mind. 

Tokens can only be applied to the entire layer. 
- In the case of Typography, you might want to apply a Token to a particular word within the text layer, but that is not possible today due to limitations of the Figma plugin API. 
	- You can check out the [feature request for this here. ](https://feedback.tokens.studio/p/multiple-token-per-layer)

## Text Styles with Variable references
**Typography Tokens** can be **Exported to Figma** as **Text Styles** that reference **Text Properties as Variables**. 

Before you export your **Typography Tokens** to Figma as styles, ensure:
- Each property within the Typography Tokens has a value referencing another Token. 

When you **Export to Figma**, select these **Options** from the menu:
- `Typography Styles` is selected. 
- `Number` and `String Variables` are selected. 
- `Create styles with variable references` is selected.

![](/token-types/tokens-typography-export-stylesvar-ref-2-01.png)

Ensure your Export to Figma as Themes or Sets configuration includes all necessary Tokens. 
- Themes and token sets where the referenced Tokens are located are `active`.
- Themes and token sets where the variables are attached may need to be configured as `reference only`. 

You'll notice these Variables are created on Export based on their Token Type:
- `fontFamily` (will create as string variable)
- `fontWeight` (will create either as string or number variable, depending on if they are a string or a number)
- `letterSpacing` (number variable)
- `lineHeight` (number variable)
- `paragraphSpacing` (number variable)
- `paragraphIndent` (number variable)

You'll notice the Text Style will be created on Export, with all possible values mapped to the appropriate Variables, based on the Token Type for each property. 
- For Tokens using percentage units, the plugin will not map this property to the variable created to preserve the responsive design decision in the token.

## W3C DTCG Token Format 
`typography` is an official token type in the W3C Design Token Community Group specifications.([9.7 Typography ](https://tr.designtokens.org/format/#typography))

However, Tokens Studio has approached **Typography Tokens** differently than how it is defined in the current spec draft. We support:
- Additional text properties not defined in the spec.
- Dedicated Token Types for each text property.

We've made these adjustments in the plugin to align with Figma's unique approach to Typography. 

## Transforming Tokens
Engineers typically transform Tokens used in code with [Style Dictionary](https://styledictionary.com/), which is tool-agnostic. Tokens coming from Tokens Studio require an additional step: [@Tokens-studio/sd-transforms](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@tokens-studio/sd-transforms), an npm package that prepares Tokens for Style Dictionary. 

When transforming **Typography Tokens**, which are a **Composite Token** with several adaptations to accommodate Figma's unique approach to Text Styling, there are specific configurations to be aware of. 

**Composite Tokens** require the SD-Transforms option to `expand composite Tokens into multiple Tokens`. 

Make sure you look at the generic SD-Transforms package to include this option, which allows you to further customize this transformation further using Style Dictionary. 

→ [SD-Transforms Read-Me Doc, Using the preprocessor](https://github.com/Tokens-studio/sd-transforms/?tab=readme-ov-file#using-the-preprocessor)
→ [SD-Transforms Read-Me Doc, Using Expand](https://github.com/Tokens-studio/sd-transforms/?tab=readme-ov-file#using-expand)

<Callout type="info" emoji="✦">
*"object, object"*\
When you transform your Typography Tokens and they show "object, object", it means your SD-Transforms configuration needs to be adjusted to include "expand".
</Callout>

If you are working in Android Compose, there is an optional transform to convert `typography objects` into Android Compose shorthand (platform option).

[→ SD-Transforms Read Me Doc, ts/typography/compose/shorthand](https://github.com/Tokens-studio/sd-transforms/?tab=readme-ov-file#options)

Each property defined within the **Typography Token** has individual SD-Transform configurations to be aware of, which can all be found on the [Read Me page on Github.](https://github.com/tokens-studio/sd-transforms/blob/main/README.md)
