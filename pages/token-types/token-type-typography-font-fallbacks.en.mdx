# Typography Font Fallbacks
Font fallbacks are a common practice in code to ensure the text remains readable even when the primary font is unavailable. 

>"A fallback font is a font face that is used when the primary font face is not loaded yet, or is missing¬†[glyphs](https://fonts.google.com/knowledge/glossary/glyph)¬†necessary to render page content. For example, the CSS below indicates that the¬†`sans-serif`¬†font family should be used as the font fallback for¬†`Roboto`" - [Chrome for Developers](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/font-fallbacks#background)

While Figma doesn't natively support font fallbacks, Tokens Studio allows you to define fallbacks for **Font Family** and **Font Weight** Token Types. 

## In the plugin
To define a fallback using the plugin, you can write the Token's value using the no-code or interface or modify the JSON file with comma-separated values. 

### Font Family Tokens
To implement font fallbacks in your Font Family Token:
- Use a comma-separated list in your token value.
- Write the Font name (string value) in order of preference, from primary to fallback options.
	- [Be sure to follow the guidelines for best practices outlined in the Font Family Token documentation.](/token-types/token-type-typography-composite)
- Figma will use the first Font Family in the list. 

Example:
```json
{
  "sans-serif": {
    "$value": "Arial, Helvetica",
    "$type": "fontFamilies"
  }
}
```

### Typography Composite Tokens
When using Typography Composite tokens, you can reference a Font Family token that includes fallbacks:

```json
{
  "body-text": {
    "value": {
      "fontFamily": "{sans-serif}",
      "fontSize": "16px",
      "fontWeight": "400"
    },
    "type": "typography"
  }
}
```

## Transforming Tokens with Fallbacks
When transforming tokens for use in code, the Style Dictionary handles font fallbacks appropriately:
- `fontFamily` Tokens that contain multiple values (comma separated) will be processed slightly for CSS to ensure that when a Font Family name contains spaces, the value is put in quotes¬†`'`¬†so it works in CSS.

## Limitations and Considerations
Figma will only display the primary font, not the fallbacks.
- When exporting to Figma variables or styles, only the primary font will be used.
- Fallbacks are primarily for web and application development, not for use within Figma itself.

While it might be tempting to use fallbacks as a way to work around Figma's nuanced way of Font Weight + Style values as a combined string, which is written differently for each Font Family, we don't recommend this approach. 
- We will always pass the first value to Figma, so if it doesn't match, you'll still get the error even if you included the correct value as a fallback. 
- Tokens are intended to be used in code, which isn't as particular as Figma. So when you engineers receive a Font Weight Token with the same value repeated multiple times it might lead to unexpected results.
