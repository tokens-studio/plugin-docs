# Creating tokens

In Tokens Studio for Figma, you can create reusable and semantic tokens which you can then reference in your design process.

Creating a new token via the UI is a simple process. As an example, create a new token in the Colors type by clicking on the + icon. In the modal that appears, give your token a name, for example “colors.blue”, with a value of #0000FF, and click on create to create your first token!

### Editing tokens
To change the value of an existing token, right click the token you wish to edit and select `Edit Token`. You can also change the name of the token. Doing so will then display a modal asking whether or not you would like to remap all your tokens using colors.blue to colors.blue.500. You can then select the type of remapping method: selection, page or document.

### Duplicating tokens
To duplicate a token, right click the token you wish to duplicate and select `Duplicate Token`. In addition to being able to duplicate a token, you can also select the set in which you want the token to be duplicated into.

### Token groups
As having a lot of tokens can become quite messy, you can use dot-notation in the token names to create nesting. For instance, you could have a token named "colors.button.background.primary”. This nesting approach helps keep your tokens structured and avoids clutter.

You can also remove token groups by right-clicking them and selecting `Delete` which will remove all tokens under that group.
