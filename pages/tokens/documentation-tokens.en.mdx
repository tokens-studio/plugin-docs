# Documentation tokens

To make it easier for you to create a living token documentation, version 50 introduced documentation tokens. With documentation tokens, you are able to create a reference sheet that is linked to your tokens and will update whenever you update your tokens, such as the one in this example:

![](/size-example.jpg)

### How do I get my own token sheet?

1. Select a text layer
2. Right click the token you want to reference
3. Select documentation token choices: Name, raw value, value (with all aliases resolved) and description.
4. Whenever you change the value of a token (or it's description) the text content of this layer will update.
