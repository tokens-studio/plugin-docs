Already have variables setup in your file but want to sync them into Tokens Studio for Figma? You can find the `Import Variables` option in the Styles & Variables menu at the bottom of the plugin. Once you click on â€˜Import Variablesâ€™, you are presented with two options in the following modal. `Convert Numbers to Dimensions` and `Use REM for Dimension Values`.

## Convert Numbers to Dimensions

With â€˜Convert Numbers to Dimensionsâ€™ selected, number variables are converted to tokens under the `Dimension` type.

**Note:** Spacing variables arenâ€™t converted into tokens under the â€˜Spacingâ€™ type but are instead created as a token-group named `Spacing`, under the `Dimension` type.
If the option is unchecked then the same will be imported but under the `Number` type.

## REM for Dimension Values

Selecting the â€˜Use REM for Dimension Valuesâ€™ option converts all your variables using numbers by dividing back for isntance a value of `16` to be `1 rem`. 

## Using References As Values
---

<Callout emoji="ðŸ’¡">
   - If your number value is a reference, then when have both import options checked the plugin's going to create tokens with the following value, `NaNrem` (Not a Number). 

   - If you have numbers to dimensions unchecked and rem for dimensons checked, the plugin's going to create tokens with `Obeject Object` as values. 
</Callout>

**NOTE:** To have the correct number references created as tokens, you need to have the option `Convert to Dimensions` checked and `REM for Dimension` unchecked.

## Import Structure
---
<img src='/modes-collections.png' alt="Translation of Variable Modes and Collections to Tokens Studio" width="800"/>

- Variable collections are imported as folders in the plugin
- Modes are imported as sets under their respective folders

## Limitations
- If you've imported variables and then create variables from tokens will not update your existing variables but will instead delete the collections.
- If any changes were made to your variables, you need to use the `Import Variables` function and not the `Sync Variables` function to update your tokens. 

<Callout emoji="ðŸ’¡">
  Importing variables doesn't officialy link/connect to tokens. So applying tokens won't apply its corresponding variable, yet.
